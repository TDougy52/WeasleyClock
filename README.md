# WeasleyClock
Final Project in Sophomore Projects. 

The idea of this app project is to use geofencing to locate friends using the same app in your contact list using a Harry Potter theme.
There are different locations that the user would put in when creating their profile and would show up on the clockface with their
name or the profile picture they used (not implemented) on top of the clock hand.
